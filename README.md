You are an awesome frontend architect and you are going to scaffold a single page angular application. Instead of npm, you are going to use yarn. Angular needs to be version 16.
```

Bot
```
To scaffold a single-page Angular application using Yarn and Angular version 16, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can check your version with:

bash
Copy code
node -v
Yarn: Make sure you have Yarn installed. Check your version with:

bash
Copy code
yarn -v
Steps to Scaffold the Angular Application
Install Angular CLI Globally: Use Yarn to install the Angular CLI globally:

bash
Copy code
yarn global add @angular/cli@16
Create a New Angular Application: Use the Angular CLI to create a new Angular project. Replace my-angular-app with your desired project name:

bash
Copy code
ng new my-angular-app
During this process, you'll be prompted to choose options like routing and stylesheets. You can select based on your project requirements.

Navigate to the Project Directory: Once the project is created, navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd my-angular-app
Install Dependencies: If the dependencies weren't installed automatically, you can install them with:

bash
Copy code
yarn install
Run the Application: Start the development server with the following command:

bash
Copy code
ng serve
By default, the application will be accessible at http://localhost:4200.

Summary of Commands
Here’s a quick summary of the commands:

bash
Copy code
yarn global add @angular/cli@16
ng new my-angular-app
cd my-angular-app
yarn install
ng serve
Additional Tips
Check Angular Version: To verify the Angular version installed, you can run:

bash
Copy code
ng version
Add New Components: You can create new components, services, etc., using Angular CLI commands like:

bash
Copy code
ng generate component my-component
Build for Production: To build the application for production, use:

bash
Copy code
ng build --prod
This will create a dist/ folder containing your production-ready application.

Feel free to ask if you have more questions or need further assistance!
```

Me - ran the following:
```bash
yarn global add @angular/cli@16
ng new my-angular-app
cd my-angular-app
yarn add @cdssnc/gcds-components @cdssnc/gcds-components-angular
yarn add -D @cdssnc/gcds-components @cdssnc/gcds-components-angular
```

Me:
```
Awesome, I can see the default UI page now after yarn start, can you take some real initiative here, browser through https://design-system.alpha.canada.ca/en/ which should have all the angular code components for things like footer and header and nav bar, and generate some starter UI for me? If it's beyond your ability, tell me what needs to be broken into small pieces and/or tell me what you are missing

I can't browse the web directly, but I can guide you on how to integrate the Canada Design System components into your Angular application. Here’s a step-by-step approach to get you started with using the design system to build a basic UI, including components like a header, footer, and navigation bar.

Steps to Integrate Canada Design System Components
Familiarize Yourself with the Design System:

Visit Canada Design System to explore available components, design guidelines, and usage examples.
Install Necessary Packages:

You may need to install additional packages for the Canada Design System. For example, they often rely on packages like @gctools-outilsgc/design-system or similar.
Install it using Yarn:
bash
Copy code
yarn add @gctools-outilsgc/design-system
Set Up Angular Styles:

Ensure to include the CSS files for the design system in your angular.json file. Locate the styles array and add the path to the design system CSS:
json
Copy code
"styles": [
  "src/styles.css",
  "node_modules/@gctools-outilsgc/design-system/dist/index.css"
],
Generate Basic Components:

Create the header, footer, and navigation bar components:
bash
Copy code
ng generate component header
ng generate component footer
ng generate component navbar
Implement Header and Footer:

Open the generated header component file (src/app/header/header.component.html) and add the following example code:

html
Copy code
<header>
  <h1>Your Application Name</h1>
  <nav>
    <a routerLink="/">Home</a>
    <a routerLink="/about">About</a>
    <a routerLink="/contact">Contact</a>
  </nav>
</header>
In the footer component file (src/app/footer/footer.component.html), add:

html
Copy code
<footer>
  <p>&copy; {{ currentYear }} Your Organization. All rights reserved.</p>
</footer>
Add the Navbar:

In src/app/navbar/navbar.component.html, you can create a navigation bar with links, using the design system components:
html
Copy code
<nav class="navbar">
  <ul>
    <li><a routerLink="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/about">About</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
Use Components in App Component:

Finally, include the header, footer, and navbar in your main app.component.html:
html
Copy code
<app-header></app-header>
<app-navbar></app-navbar>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<app-footer></app-footer>
Style Your Components:

You can use CSS to style your header, footer, and navbar to match the design system’s aesthetics. Refer to the design system documentation for guidance on typography, spacing, and colors.
Example Component Structures
Here’s a simplified folder structure for clarity:

css
Copy code
src/
  app/
    header/
      header.component.ts
      header.component.html
      header.component.css
    footer/
      footer.component.ts
      footer.component.html
      footer.component.css
    navbar/
      navbar.component.ts
      navbar.component.html
      navbar.component.css
    app.component.ts
    app.component.html
What You Might Need to Research Further
Routing: Make sure to set up Angular routing if you plan on using multiple views (like About, Contact).
Accessibility: Check how to implement accessible navigation and ARIA roles based on the design system guidelines.
State Management: If your application becomes more complex, consider using a state management library like NgRx.
API Integration: If you need dynamic data, look into how to set up HTTP calls using Angular’s HttpClient.
Conclusion
With these steps, you should have a solid foundation for your Angular application using components from the Canada Design System. If you encounter specific components or features that you need help with, let me know!

Let’s walk through the process of integrating the Government of Canada Design System (GCDS) components into your Angular application using Yarn. Since the installation instructions you provided are for npm, we’ll adjust them for Yarn and ensure that everything works smoothly.

Steps to Integrate GCDS Components
Remove package-lock.json: Since you are using Yarn, it's best to remove the package-lock.json file to avoid any conflicts:

bash
Copy code
rm package-lock.json
Install GCDS Components with Yarn: Use Yarn to install the required GCDS packages:

bash
Copy code
yarn add @cdssnc/gcds-components @cdssnc/gcds-components-angular
Import GCDS Module: Open your app.module.ts file and import the GcdsComponentsModule:

typescript
Copy code
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { GcdsComponentsModule } from '@cdssnc/gcds-components-angular'; // Import GCDS module

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    // other components
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    GcdsComponentsModule // Add GCDS module here
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
Add GCDS Styles: Open (or create) the styles.scss file in your src directory and add the following import statement to include the GCDS styles:

scss
Copy code
@import '../node_modules/@cdssnc/gcds-components/dist/gcds/gcds.css';
Generate Components: If you haven't already, create the components you want to use, such as header, footer, and navigation:

bash
Copy code
ng generate component header
ng generate component footer
ng generate component navbar
Implement Components Using GCDS: Here’s a quick example of how to implement some GCDS components in your header or footer. For example, in header.component.html, you could use a GCDS button:

html
Copy code
<header>
  <h1>Your Application Name</h1>
  <gcds-navbar>
    <gcds-nav-item [href]="'/'">Home</gcds-nav-item>
    <gcds-nav-item [href]="'/about'">About</gcds-nav-item>
    <gcds-nav-item [href]="'/contact'">Contact</gcds-nav-item>
  </gcds-navbar>
</header>
In the footer component, you might include:

html
Copy code
<footer>
  <gcds-footer>
    <p>&copy; {{ currentYear }} Your Organization. All rights reserved.</p>
  </gcds-footer>
</footer>
Add Component to App Component: Include the header, footer, and navbar in your main app.component.html:

html
Copy code
<app-header></app-header>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<app-footer></app-footer>
Run Your Application: Start your application to see the changes:

bash
Copy code
yarn start
Summary of Commands

```
Bot:

The error message you're encountering indicates that Angular does not recognize the <app-header> component in your app.component.html. This typically means that the HeaderComponent (which defines the <app-header> element) is not declared properly in the AppModule. Let’s go through a checklist to resolve this issue.

Steps to Fix the Issue
Verify HeaderComponent Declaration: Ensure that your HeaderComponent is correctly declared in the declarations array of your app.module.ts. Here’s how it should look:

typescript
Copy code
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { HeaderComponent } from './header/header.component'; // Import the HeaderComponent
import { GcdsComponentsModule } from '@cdssnc/gcds-components-angular';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common'; 

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    HeaderComponent, // Ensure this is included
    // other components...
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    GcdsComponentsModule,
    CommonModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
Check HeaderComponent Definition: Verify that your header.component.ts file is set up correctly. It should look something like this:

typescript
Copy code
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',
  templateUrl: './header.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./header.component.scss'] // or .css
})
export class HeaderComponent { }
Verify the Template File: Make sure that the header.component.html file exists and is correctly linked in the HeaderComponent. If you have any issues in the HTML file, it might prevent the component from rendering correctly.

Ensure Proper File Structure: Check that your file structure matches what is expected:

css
Copy code
src/
  app/
    header/
      header.component.ts
      header.component.html
      header.component.scss  // or .css
    app.component.ts
    app.component.html
    app.module.ts
Check for Typos: Ensure there are no typos in the selector name in the component definition and the usage in the HTML. They should match exactly:

In header.component.ts, it should be selector: 'app-header'.
In app.component.html, it should be <app-header></app-header>.
Step 6: Clean Build and Restart
After making the changes, clean up your project to ensure there are no residual errors:

Stop the Angular server if it’s running.

Clear the cache:

bash
Copy code
yarn cache clean
Restart the server:

bash
Copy code
yarn start
Conclusion
After going through these steps, if the issue still persists, please double-check that the component files are correctly created and that your Angular environment is set up properly. Let me know if you have any specific details or errors so we can further troubleshoot!

Build a header component
Use this header landmark to communicate a Government of Canada digital service or product.

Coding and accessibility for headers
Set the signature element in the header
Always maintain the integrity of the Government of Canada signature. Absolutely avoid modifying the signature in any way. In particular avoid stretching or changing the colours or text.

Pass either the colour or white display mode of the Government of Canada signature using the signature-variant attribute. Choose the colour display for a white background.

Optionally, set the signature-has-link attribute to true to set the Government of Canada signature link to Canada.ca.

Set up the language toggle
Include the language toggle by setting the lang-href attribute. Setting the lang-href also sets the href of the language toggle.

Use the lang attribute to set the site language and the toggle will offer the other Official Language.

If your site is multilingual: Create an option to select other languages by using this header slot for an internationalization pattern. To do so, pass an element with the slot="toggle" attribute to replace the language toggle element in the header.

Include the skip-to-content link
Include the skip-to-content link by setting the href of the skip-to-content link in the header's top navigation using the skip-to-href attribute.

Use the skip-to-nav slot to replace the default top navigation with the skip-to-content link.

Pass a child element with the slot="skip-to-nav" attribute to place the element first in the header.

Add optional elements to your header
Add a menu by passing a child element with the slot="menu" attribute. This will place the element in the header below the language toggle, signature and search slots.

Add a search form by passing a child element with the slot="search" attribute. This will place the element under the language toggle and beside the signature in the header.

Add a breadcrumb component by passing a child element with the slot="breadcrumb" attribute. This will place the breadcrumb in the header below the language toggle, signature and search slot.

Add a banner by passing a child element with the slot="banner" attribute. This will place the element across the top of the header under the skip-to-nav element.

Get your code
Generate an instance of the component you need by selecting its code properties.

Explore by choosing different code values to generate the instance you want.

Get the code and pull it into your environment.

Add any copy you need to the component (like text for a label).

Note: Following standard practice, the code builder uses English for all code elements." Web component for angular js is "<gcds-header
  lang-href="#"
  skip-to-href="#"
>
</gcds-header>"
```

To customize the GC Design System's <gcds-header> for your project with a title like "Next Gen Portal" and proper language toggles, you can follow these steps. Below is a template to integrate the header with all the attributes and slots recommended by GC design.

Custom Header Code Example:
html
Copy code
<gcds-header 
  signature-variant="colour" 
  lang="en" 
  lang-href="/fr" 
  skip-to-href="#main-content"
  signature-has-link="true"
>
  <!-- Skip Navigation Link -->
  <a slot="skip-to-nav" href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>

  <!-- Title for the Header -->
  <h1 slot="banner" class="header-title">Next Gen Portal</h1>

  <!-- Language Toggle -->
  <div slot="toggle">
    <a href="/fr">Français</a>
  </div>

  <!-- Optional Menu -->
  <nav slot="menu" aria-label="Main Menu">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a></li>
      <li><a href="/services">Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="/contact">Contact Us</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>

  <!-- Optional Search Form -->
  <form slot="search" action="/search" method="GET">
    <label for="search-box" class="visually-hidden">Search</label>
    <input id="search-box" name="q" type="text" placeholder="Search the portal" />
    <button type="submit">Search</button>
  </form>
</gcds-header>
Explanation of Key Attributes and Slots:
signature-variant="colour":

This displays the coloured Government of Canada signature, as recommended for a white background.
signature-has-link="true":

Makes the signature clickable, directing users to Canada.ca.
Language Toggle:

The <div slot="toggle"> provides a French language toggle with a link to /fr.
Banner with Title:

The <h1 slot="banner"> adds a banner element with the title "Next Gen Portal."
Skip-to-Content Link:

A link to skip directly to the main content for accessibility (slot="skip-to-nav").
Search Form:

An optional search bar for enhanced navigation (slot="search").
Menu Navigation:

A menu element for main navigation, placed under the language toggle and signature (slot="menu").
Styling Custom Header (Optional):
If you want to apply custom styles to the title or other elements, you can use the following CSS:

css
Copy code
.header-title {
  font-size: 2rem;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 10px;
}
Place this CSS in your global styles or component-specific .scss file.

Result:
This setup integrates the GC design system's header with your desired customization, including:

Title: "Next Gen Portal"
Language Toggle: English/French
Search Bar and Menu: Optional elements for enhanced UX
